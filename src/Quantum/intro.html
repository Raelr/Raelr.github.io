                I am not a quantum physicist, nor am I a full quantum computer scientist. 
                Every piece of information contained in these pages is something which I discovered in my own research. 
                I hope this is useful in at least explaining some concepts behind quantum computing to those who are 
                interested by the concept, but are overwhelmed by the mathematics a language behind it.

            <p class="text-standard">
                In November 2019, I was approached by my professor with an offer to work on an interesting project. 
                The Quantum computing department was looking for a way to present quantum computing to prospective 
                students without overwhelming them with numbers, equations, and odd terminology. This presented an 
                interesting problem: how can we make quantum computing more accessible to students? More than that, 
                how can we present it in a manner that doesn't dilute the concept, but also keeps it simple enough
                to understand? 
            </p>
            <p class="text-standard">
                The result of these discussions was a 5 week project to put together a basic prototype of a quantum
                based game. I knew very little of quantum computing at this point, and was required to learn on the 
                job. The result was a hastily put together simulation which, whilst imperfect, was able to mimic 
                the basic properties of a quantum circuit.

                The purpose of this document is to try and note down all the essential details required to 
                have a cursory understanding of quantum computing. In the five weeks in which I worked on this 
                project, I encountered a myriad of obstacles pertaining to the accessibility of information and 
                knowledge in the quantum area. I would often try and find an answer to some problem and be faced 
                with pages of unintelligible equations and mathematical jargon. This made the task of understanding 
                the processes behind quantum computing almost impossible, and felt more like I was deciphering an 
                alien language than understanding a scientific concept. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-standard">
                This document is therefore my attempt to aggregate all the pieces of knowledge which I gained 
                over those five weeks and compile them into an easy to understand ‘manual’ of sorts. The hope is 
                that anyone wishing to pick up where I left off can have a simple guide which was written specifically 
                for them. It is my hope that I can try and explain quantum computing in a manner that can be understood 
                by those outside of the mathematical space.

            <h2 class="header-text2">Chapter 1 - What is Quantum Computing?</h2>
            <p class="text-standard">
                I can’t really explain fully what quantum computing really is, but I can explain 
                (to a certain extent) what it does. A simple (but somewhat unhelpful) explanation 
                can be summed as follows: Quantum computing is a system whereby calculations can 
                be made using the probabilities of an object’s state, rather than its actual measured 
                state. Whereas a classical computer uses classical bits (1 or 0) as their basic unit 
                of measurement, a quantum computer uses quantum bits (or qubits) which range BETWEEN 
                1 and 0. As such, a qubit can be any number between 1 and 0 (such as 0.5 or 0.25). 
            </p>
            <p class="text-standard">
                A qubit’s value does not represent a concrete value, but rather a probability of what 
                the value WILL be. The closer the value is to 0, the higher the chance is of it defaulting 
                to 0 and vice versa for the proximity to 1. These qubits keep the probabilities stored 
                within up until the point where they are measured. When this occurs, the qubits immediately 
                switch to either 1 or 0, depending on the probabilities stored within. As such, a qubit which 
                stores a value of 0.5 will have exactly 50% chance to turn into a 1 or a 0, while a qubit of 0.75 
                as a 75% of becoming a 1 and 25% chance of becoming a 0. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-standard">
                An unmeasured qubit cannot be fully used by a computer, and must be measured before it can be 
                utilised for data. As such, a lot of the work that quantum computers do is in preprocessing - where 
                qubits are put through mathematical filters and then converted to classical bits once the main 
                processes are done. The result is a data unit which can store a lot more data than a classical bit, 
                and has far more flexibility and utility.
